# AutoKeyboard for iOS written in Swift

Automatic Keyboard handling with ease. It is fully automatic keyboard handling. Like in android no need to resize views when keyboard appears. It updates constraints which are bounded with `bottomLayoutGuide` or `safeAreaLayoutGuide`. Like `bottomLayoutGuide` or `safeAreaLayoutGuide` moves UP and DOWN with keyboard. Just need to `register` and `unResgister` thats it.
